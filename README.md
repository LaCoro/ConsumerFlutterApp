## How to configure the backend

LaCoro uses [back4app](https://www.back4app.com/) as backend as service. You need to have a back4app account or create a new one to configure your instance of the LaCoro backend. Then, you need to go to our [LaCoro public DB](https://www.back4app.com/database/admin7/lacoro) and clone that into your back4app account.

After that, you will be able to get the keys to establishing a connection for the Consumer App and Admin App with your brand new backend.

## Setting up your dot.env file
LaCoro uses [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) package in order to set the envrionment variables.
Once you get the back4app credentials you need to add a `development.env` file.

Follow the strucutre defined in [`mock-development.env`](https://github.com/LaCoro/ConsumerFlutterApp/blob/develop/mock-development.env)
