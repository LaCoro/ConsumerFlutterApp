## How to configure the backend

LaCoro uses [back4app](https://www.back4app.com/) as backend as service. You need to have a back4app account or create a new one to configure your instance of the LaCoro backend. Then, you need to go to the LaCoro public [DB](https://www.back4app.com/database/admin7/lacoro) and clone that into your back4app account.

After that, you will be able to get the keys to establishing a connection for the Consumer App and Admin App with your brand new backend.
